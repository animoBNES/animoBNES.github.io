# SETS THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES NEEDED BY MOODY.  
# Note 1: source etc/bashrc also needs to be called if moody is run via the matlab interface (if install dir is not in path in any other way)
#         That case handled by addMoodyPath.m in API/matlab folder.

# Moody install directory
moodyDir=$(cd $(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE:-$0})/.. && pwd -P)  # to get the absolute path.

# Export environment flags
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$moodyDir/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
export PATH=$moodyDir/bin:$PATH

# Optional: Put symbolic links in user home dirs bin and lib
# ln -sf $moodyDir/bin/*.x $HOME/bin
# ln -sf $moodyDir/lib/*.so $HOME/lib
