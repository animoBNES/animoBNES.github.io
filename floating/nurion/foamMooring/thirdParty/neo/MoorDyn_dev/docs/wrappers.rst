Wrappers
=====================================================

As of version v2, MoorDyn provides several wrappers so it can be easily used
in some other languages.

Currently MoorDyn can be used in C++, C, Python, Fortran and Matlab. You can
read more on how to install MoorDyn for each different language in
:ref:`the installation documentation <starting>`. It is also strongly
recommended to visit :ref:`the coupling documentation <coupling>` to get a
quick idea on how to use MoorDyn in your favorite language.

All the wrappers are heavily related with :ref:`the C API <api_c>`, so it is
the best place to find a list of available functions.
